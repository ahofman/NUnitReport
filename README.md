NUnitReport
===========

An XSLT stylesheet for displaying pretty NUnit test reports in HTML.

NUnitReport is designed as a very simple replacement for the (now defunct) NUnit2Report. 
It's simpler in that it requires no MSXML extensions to run, and its just a single XSLT stylesheet file which is easily portable.
